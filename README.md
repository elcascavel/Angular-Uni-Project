# Angular University Project

This project was developed during the second semester of the course "Ferramentas e Aplicações Multimédia" at Universidade-Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro. The purpose of this project was to introduce us to Angular, a front-end framework, and help us understand its functionalities. This project was developed using **Angular 12.0.5**. It has been updated to **Angular 16.1.0**.

## Getting Started

Before getting started, ensure that you have the Angular CLI installed globally. You can find installation instructions [here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#installation).

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal.
2. Run `ng serve` to start a development server.
3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. Alternatively, you can use `ng serve --open` to automatically open the page in your default web browser.
4. Any changes you make to the source files will trigger an automatic reload of the application.

## Functionality Overview

This application offers limited features as it was developed following the guidelines provided by our professor. The main objective was to create and utilize four different components and explore how they can interact with each other.

Additionally, we implemented a model in the footer component to retrieve information, such as our names. Building on this concept, we extended the functionality to the card component, which displays information about different artists directly from our model.

Feel free to explore the application and familiarize yourself with Angular's component-based architecture.
