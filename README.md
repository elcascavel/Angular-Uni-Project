# Angular University Project

Project created during the second semester of the course "Ferramentas e Aplicações Multimédia" taken at Universidade-Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro. This project paved the way for us to get acquainted with Angular, understanding what a front-end framework is and what it does.

# Getting started

Make sure you have the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#installation) installed globally.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. Alternatively `ng serve --open` will open the page on your default web browser automatically. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Functionality overview

This application has little features. Our goal, following guidelines set by our professor, was to use four different components and understanding how they can work together. Apart from that we were asked to use a model in our footer component that retrieved information like our names. We decided to expand on this idea and use this for the card component, feeding it information of the different artists on display directly from our model.
